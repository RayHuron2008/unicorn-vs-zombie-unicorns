# Unicorn vs Zombie Unicorns â€” Musicâ€‘Ready Mobile Build

This version is **pre-wired for audio**. You just drop MP3s into `/assets` with these exact names:

```
assets/
  bgm_main.mp3
  bgm_boss.mp3
  jingle_victory.mp3
  jingle_gameover.mp3
  sfx_ray.mp3            (optional)
  sfx_headbutt.mp3       (optional)
```

## How to use
1. Put your Suno MP3s into the **assets** folder.
2. Open `index.html` locally or deploy to GitHub Pages (Settings â†’ Pages â†’ Deploy from branch â†’ root).
3. On mobile, **tap A/B or Resume once** to start music (browser rule). Use the **Pause** menu to **Mute**.

## Gameplay (same as prototype)
- Landscape mobile controls (Dâ€‘Pad, A attack/ray, B sprint), pause button
- Score, lives, power meter; extra life every 10 kills
- Special zombie grants **ray gun** for 30s and temporarily switches to boss music
- Friendly pastel zombies in a bright rainbow world

Enjoy! ðŸŽ‰
